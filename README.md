# Messing With [MEDA](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/meda/) 

This is a mini-project doing some wild forecasting of the seasonal pressure cycle on Mars with neural nets.

To learn about and download the data, see the [planetary atmospheres node](https://atmos.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/PERSEVERANCE/meda.html).

Initial data processing scripts are in the [`scripts`](scripts) folder.

Look at the Julia [notebook](messing_with_meda.ipynb) for the neural nets!
